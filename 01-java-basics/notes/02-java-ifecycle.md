# Java Application Development Lifecycle

This note explains the **Java Application Development Lifecycle** and three core components:

- JDK (Java Development Kit)
- JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
- JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

---

# 1. Java Development Kit (JDK)

**JDK (Java Development Kit)** is a software package used by developers to create Java applications.

It includes tools required to **develop, compile, debug, and run Java programs**.

## Main Features

- Provides tools like:
  - `javac` (compiler)
  - `java` (runtime launcher)
  - `jdb` (debugger)
- Contains **JRE**
- Allows development and execution of Java programs
- Works on multiple operating systems:
  - Windows
  - Linux
  - macOS

# 2. Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

**JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** is an **abstract machine** that executes Java bytecode.

It provides a **runtime environment** where Java programs run.

Java source code is first compiled into **bytecode**, then JVM converts it into **machine code**.

## Main Features

- Converts **bytecode → machine code**
- Provides:
  - Memory management
  - Garbage collection
  - Security
- Platform independent
- Runs programs using libraries provided by **JRE**

---

# 3. Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

**JRE (Java Runtime Environment)** provides the environment required to **run Java applications**.

It includes:

- JVM
- Core libraries
- Supporting runtime files

Developers **cannot compile programs using JRE**, only **run them**.

## Main Features

- Contains JVM
- Provides runtime libraries
- Supports technologies like:
  - JDBC
  - RMI
  - JNDI
- Allows Java programs to run on different systems
